## From The Garden Website

By: Sean Reddington\
Date: ~Spring 2015?\


This was the final project for my Web Design class at Bloomsburg University.
The concepts including company, text, info was worked on as a group,
but we then split up to design and build our own websites.


This website was designed using Adobe's Dreamweaver and Muse.
